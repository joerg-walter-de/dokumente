    2. Ordinary members can persuant to § 6 of the association's statute apply for a reduction of the membership fees. The informal application must be substantiated. The reasoning may be based on the reception of social benefits persuant to SGB I ff. The application will be decided by the executive commitee with simple majority within 14 days. The payable fee is determined by the executive commitee based on the individual case. The member is informed immediately with no specific form necessary.

    3. Payment of membership fees must be made by bank transfer to the association account or by direct debit.
